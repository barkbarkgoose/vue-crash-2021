## Dependencies

You will need to set up two files for this to work, they're not tracked so the data in them doesn't get mangled.

- db.json
- package.json

for both there is a _.bak_ file present in the repo that can be used as a template.  Note that in package.json the exact versions of javascript, node, packages, etc. may be different than what is running on your system.
